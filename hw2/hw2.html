    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1> <!-- This is a heading -->
    <!-- Add a paragraph -->
    <p>
        HTML is an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language. It is also known as &quot;The Language of the Web.&quot; HTML is the brainchild of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who also developed the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. Together the three technologies make the Web possible.
    </p>
    <!-- Add a paragraph -->
    <p>
        The paragraph element is one of the basic building blocks of HTML. It is a block level element, which means that it breaks the flow of the content of the page as it is rendered and adds whitespace before and after.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic HTML</h2>
    <p>
        There are a number of HTML tags and elements that we will explore this semester, including anchor tags (for hyperlinks), img (for images), strong, em, b, i, ul (lists), ol (numbered lists), hr (horizontal rule), br (line break), divs, spans, and many, many more.
    </p>
    <h2>Remember</h2>
    <p>
        This is a very basic web page. Gradually, as the semester progresses, we will learn how to make more complex pages, as well as how to modify their appearance with CSS.
